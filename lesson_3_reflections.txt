Q:	When would you want to use a remote repository rather than
	keeping all your work local?
A:	I put my personal work on GitHub so that I can work on it from
	anywhere (given I can set up some sort of dev environment).  It
	is also useful to have your repo online, so others can access it
	if they are also working on the project.  It's also important to
	support open source development, so making your source available
	to the public does that as well.
