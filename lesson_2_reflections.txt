Q:	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need
	to do it?
A:	It creates the .git directory and intilizes some values and
	configurations inside it.  This is where git will store files
	as they initially appear in the repository as well as modifcations
	for those files over time (commits).

Q:	How is the staging area different from the working directory and
	the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A:	The working directory is the actual directory where the files are
	located on your filesystem, while the staging directory is more
	of a logical location via status for each file in your working
	directory.  This allows each commit to contain only the adds/
	modifications you want.
